<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Berkeley DB Java Edition (JE) is a 100% pure Java embedded, transactional data
store. It supplies a key/object data model with indexing, full transactional
ACID support, POJO APIs and High Availability/Replication.
<p>
As of version 7.3, JE is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. See the LICENSE
file for the complete license.
<p>
Note that in JE 7.0 and later, the Java compatibility requirement for JE is
Java SE 8.
<p>
JE is compatible with Java SE 8 (64-bit) and later, and has been tested and
certified against Oracle JDK 1.8.0_121 and IBM J9 7.0. We encourage you to
upgrade to the latest Java releases to take advantage of the latest bug fixes
and performance improvements.
<p>
Be sure to see the <a href="changelog.html">change log</a> for information
about upgrading from earlier releases.
<p>
This release contains a number of changes, including:
<ol>
    <li>
        MAX_DISK and FREE_DISK configuration parameters have been added for
        limiting disk usage, and read operations are now allowed when these
        thresholds are exceeded.  Previously no thresholds were used, and the
        Environment was invalidated and closed when the volume was filled.
        Allowing read operations now provides partial availability even when
        writes are no longer possible. New statistics for disk usage
        monitoring have also been added.  [#25220]
        <dl>
            <dd>
                NOTE: Behavior has changed regarding the retention of data
                files reserved for replication, and specifying the new
                MAX_DISK parameter is strongly recommended for HA
                applications. Use of the new disk monitoring statistics,
                rather than monitoring of raw disk utilization, is especially
                important for HA applications due of the presence of reserved
                data files.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
    <li>
        The data verifier has been enhanced to perform Btree verification in
        order to detect internal corruption, included secondary index
        corruption.  Btree verification is performed by the background data
        verifier, the DbVerify utility, the DbVerify.verify method, the
        Database.verify method and the Environment.verify method.  [#25960]
        <p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Several important bug fixes are included.
    </li>
</ol>
