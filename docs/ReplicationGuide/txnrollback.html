      <p>
            In the event that a new Master is elected, it is possible for a
            Replica to find that some of its logs are ahead of the logs
            held by the Master. While this is unlikely to occur, your code
            must still be ready to deal with the situation. When it
            happens, you must roll back the transactions represented by the
            logs that are ahead of the Master.
        </p>
      <p>
            You do this by simply closing all your <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/ReplicatedEnvironment.html" target="_top">ReplicatedEnvironment</a>
            handles, and then reopening. During the handshaking process
            that occurs when the Replica joins the replication group, the
            discrepancy in log files is resolved for you.
        </p>
      <p>
            Note that the problem of logs on replicas being ahead of the
            log on the master is unlikely to occur because the election
            mechanism favors nodes with the most recent logs. When
            selecting a master, a simple majority of nodes are required to
            vote on the choice of master, and they will vote for the node
            with the most recent log files. When the problem does occur,
            though, it results in the updates reflected in the Replica's
            log being discarded when the log is rolled back. 
        </p>
      <p>
            Logs on a Replica can be ahead of the logs on the Master if
            network or node failures result in transactions becoming
            durable on fewer than a majority of the nodes in the
            replication group. This reduced durability is more likely in
            cases where one or more Replicas show large replication lags
            relative to the Master. Administrators should monitor
            replication lags and evaluate whether they are caused by issues
            with network or host performance. Applications can reduce the
            chance of transaction rollbacks by avoiding the use of weak
            durability requirements like
            <code class="literal">ReplicaAckPolicy.NONE</code> or a
            <code class="literal">ReplicationMutableConfig.NODE_PRIORITY</code> of
            zero.

            JE HA lets your application know that a transaction must be
            rolled back by throwing <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/RollbackException.html" target="_top">RollbackException</a>. This exception can
            by thrown by any operation that is performing routine database
            access.
