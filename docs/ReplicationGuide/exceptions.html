            JE HA requires you to manage more error situations that you
            would have to if you were writing a non-replicated application.
            These error situations translate to additional exceptions that
            you must contend with in your code.  Before continuing with our
            description of how to write a replicated application, it is
            useful to review the HA-specific exceptions that your
            application must manage.
        </p>

                There are two exceptions that you can see on a Master node,
                and which you will not see anywhere else. They are:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">

              <p>
                        This exception can be raised on a transaction begin or commit. It means that the
                        Master cannot successfully commit a transaction, or begin one,  because it is not in contact
                        with enough Electable Replicas. The number of Electable Replicas required to successfully commit
                        the transaction is a function of the durability policy that
                        you have set for the transaction. See
                        <a class="xref" href="txn-management.html#durability" title="Managing Durability">Managing Durability</a>
                        for more information.
                    </p>
              <p>
                        If raised on a transaction commit operation, this
                        exception means that the transaction has not been
                        committed. Instead, it has been marked as invalid.
                        In response to this exception, your application
                        must at a minimum abort the transaction. It is up
                        to you whether you want to retry the transaction at
                        some later time when more Replicas are in contact
                        with the Master.
                    </p>
              <p>
                        If raised on a transaction begin operation, this
                        exception means that the transaction has not begun.
                        If the application intended to initiate a read-only
                        transaction on a Master, it can avoid this
                        exception by ensuring that the transaction is
                        configured to not require any acknowledgments. For
                        information on configuring acknowledgments, see

              <p>
                        This exception can be raised on a transaction commit. It means that the
                        Master has successfully committed the transaction locally, but it has not
                        received enough acknowledgements from its Electable Replicas in the timeframe
                        allocated for acknowledgements to be received.

              <p>
                        The application should respond to this exception in such a way as to alert
                        the administrator that there might be a problem with the health of the
                        network or the nodes participating in the replication group.

                The exceptions that you can see on a Replica, and nowhere else, are:

              <p>
                        If this exception is encountered frequently, it indicates that the
                        consistency policy requirements are too strict and cannot be met routinely
                        given the load being placed on the system and the hardware resources that
                        are available to service the load. The exception may also indicate that
                        there is a network related issue that is preventing the Replica from
                        communicating with the Master and keeping up with the replication stream.

              <p>
                        In response to this exception, your application can either attempt to retry
                        the transaction, or you can relax your application's consistency
                        requirements until the transaction can successfully complete.

                        An attempt was made to perform a write operation on a Replica. The exception
                        typically indicates an error in the application logic. In some extremely
                        rare cases it could be the result of a transition of the node from Master to
                        Replica, while a transaction was in progress.

        <p>
                This exception typically indicates that there is a problem with your physical
                infrastructure. It might mean that an insufficient number of electable nodes are available to
                elect a Master, or that the current node is unable to communicate with other nodes
                due to, for example, network problems.

                In response to this exception, your application can try any number of corrective
                actions, from immediately retrying the operation, to logging the problem and then
                abandoning the operation, to waiting some predetermined period of time before
                attempting the operation again. Your application can also
