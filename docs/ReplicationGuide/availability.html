              A key difference between standalone JE and JE HA is
              that for standalone JE the environment is available for
              both reads and writes as long as the application (including
              the underlying hardware) is functioning correctly. That is,
              the availability of a standalone JE application is
              independent of the local durability policy set for the
              transaction.  However, the distributed nature of JE HA, means
              that availability can be dependent upon the state of other
              nodes in the replication group. It can also be dependent upon
              the policies you set for your HA application.
          </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="writeavailability"></a>Write Availability</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
                  JE HA requires that a simple majority of electable nodes be
                  available to elect a Master. If a simple majority of those
                  nodes is not available, the group is not available for
                  writes because the group is unable to elect a Master. 
              </p>
        <p>
                  In the presence of a Master, the availability of a
                  replicated environment (at the Master) for write
                  operations is determined by the durability
                  requirements associated with the transaction: 
              </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                        If the transaction's durability requirements
                        specify an acknowledgement policy of NONE, the
                        Master is always available for write operations,
                        just as is the case for standalone JE
                        applications. 
                      </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        If the durability requirements are made more
                        stringent and specify a simple majority for
                        acknowledgements, or if all
                        the electable group members must acknowledge transaction
                        commits, the environment might not be available for
                        writes when one or more of the Electable Replicas is unable
                        to provide an acknowledgment. This loss of write
                        availability can occur even in the absence of
                        hardware failures.
                    </p>
              <p>
                        Replicas might be unable to provide
                        acknowledgements because a node is down. It could
                        also occur if the Replica is simply lagging
                        too far behind in the replication stream and so
                        needs to commit earlier transactions before it can
                        commit the current transaction. Note that in the
                        absence of system level failures, the Replica will
                        eventually commit the transaction, it just can not
                        do so in the window of time required to indicate a
                        successful commit of the transaction to the Master.
                    </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
                  In other words, a durability policy that calls for commit
                  acknowledgments can result in decreased availability of
                  the system for write operations. It is important for
                  you to keep this tradeoff in mind when choosing a
                  durability policy.

                  A Master is always available for read operations because
                  the data on it is always absolutely consistent. However,
                  Replica read availability can be affected by the
                  consistency policy that you are using:
              </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                        A Replica is always available for read operations
                        that do not have any read consistency requirements.
                        That is, when the Replica is allowed to lag
                        arbitrarily far behind the Master, then the Replica
                        will always be available to service read requests. 
                      </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        If you are using higher levels of read consistency,
                        then Replicas might not be available for read
                        operations. This occurs when the Replica is forced
                        to wait until it has caught up far enough in the
                        replication stream before it can service a read
                        operation. For example, if you choose a time
                        consistency policy, and the the Replica cannot meet
                        that consistency policy for a specific read
                        operation, then the operation might be delayed or
                        even abandoned entirely until the consistency
                        policy can be met. This represents a loss of read
                        availability.
                      </p>
              <p>
                          There are many reasons why a Replica might not be
                          able to meet a consistency policy. For example,
                          the Master might be very busy and so is unable to
                          supply the Replica with the replication stream
                          fast enough. Or, it could be because the Replica
                          is experiencing very heavy read loads and so
                          the replication stream might not be fast enough
                          to keep up. It is also possible that the Replica
                          has been down and is trying to catch up, which
                          means that it might not be able to meet a
                          consistency policy.
                      </p>
              <p>
                          All of these scenarios represent a loss of read
                          availability, albeit a temporary one.
                      </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
                  In other words, a consistency policy that requires the
                  Replica to match the state of the Master to one degree or
                  another can affect the Replica's read availability.  It
                  is important for you to keep this tradeoff in mind when
                  choosing a consistency policy.
