              All replicated applications are first transactional
              applications. This means that you have the standard data
              guarantee issues to consider, all of which have to do with
              how durable and consistent you want your data to be. Of
              course, considerations of this nature also play a role in
              your application's performance.  These issues are even more
              important for replicated applications because replication
              adds additional dimensions to them.
          </p>
      <p>
              Notably, in a replicated application you must decide how
              durable your data is, by deciding how careful the Master will
              be to make sure a data write has been written to disk on its
              various Replica nodes before completing the transaction.
          </p>
      <p>
              Consistency also adds an additional dimension in a replicated
              application, because now you must decide how consistent the
              various nodes in the replication group will be relative to
              the Master at any given time. If no writes are being
              performed on the Master, all Replicas will eventually catch
              up to the Master and so be completely consistent with it. 
              But for most HA applications, writes are occurring on the
              Master, and so it is possible for some number of your
              Replicas to lag behind the Master. What you have to decide,
              then, is how sensitive your application is to this kind of
              temporary inconsistency.
          </p>
      <p>
              Note that your consistency requirements can be gated by your
              durability requirements. Durability, in turn, can be gated by
              any concerns you might have on write throughput. At the same
              time, your consistency requirement can have an affect on the
              read performance of your Replicas. It is
              therefore a mistake to think about any one of these
              requirements in the absence of the others.

                  One of the reasons you might be writing a replicated
                  application is to achieve a higher durability guarantee
                  than you can get with a traditional transactional
                  application. In a traditional application, your data's
                  durability is a function of how you perform your
                  transactional commits, and how frequently you perform
                  your backups. For this class of application, the
                  strongest durability guarantee you can have is to use
                  synchronous commits (the commit does not
                  complete until the data is written to disk), coupled with
                  very frequent backups of your environment.
              </p>
        <p>
                  The problem with a stand-alone application in which you
                  are seeking a very high durability guarantee is that your
                  write throughput will suffer. Synchronous commits
                  require disk writes, and disk I/O is one of the most
                  expensive operations you can ask a database to perform. 
              </p>
        <p>
                  In order to increase write throughput in your
                  transactional application, you may decide to use
                  asynchronous commits that do not require the disk I/O to
                  complete before the transaction commit completes. 
                  The problem with this is that your application can
                  potentially crash before a transaction has been
                  completely written to disk. This represents a loss of
                  data, which is to say the data is not durable.
              </p>
        <p>
                  Replication can help with your data durability in a
                  couple of ways. Most importantly, replication allows you to
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>commit to the network</em></span>. This means
                  that when your Master commits a transaction, the results
                  of that commit are sent to one or more nodes available
                  over the network. Consequently, multiple disks, disk
                  controllers, power supplies, and CPUs are used to ensure
                  the data modification makes it to stable storage.
              </p>
        <p>
                  Usually JE makes the commit operation on the Master
                  wait until it receives acknowledgements from some number
                  of electable nodes before returning from the
                  operation. However, if you want to increase write
                  throughput, you can configure your Master to proceed
                  without acknowledgements, and so return immediately from
                  the commit operation (once the commit operation has met
                  the local durability requirement). The price that you pay
                  for this is a reduced durability guarantee.  How reduced
                  the guarantee is, is a function of the number of electable
                  nodes in your replication group (the more you have, the
                  higher your durability guarantee is) and the quality and
                  stability of your network.
              </p>
        <p>
                  Alternatively, you can obtain an
                  extremely high durability guarantee by configuring the Master
                  to wait for all electable nodes to acknowledge a commit
                  operation before returning from the operation. The price
                  you pay for this very high guarantee is greatly reduced
                  write throughput.

                  Data consistency means that the data you thought you
                  wrote to your environment is in fact written to your
                  environment. It also means that you will never find
                  partial records written to your environment. 
              </p>
        <p>
                  In a replicated application, consistency also means that
                  data which is available on the Master is also available
                  on the Replicas.
              </p>
        <p>
                  A simple transactional application offers consistency
                  guarantees that are enforced when you commit a
                  transaction. Your replicated application also offers this
                  consistency guarantee (because it is also a transactional
                  application). For this reason, the environment on the
                  Master is always absolutely consistent. But beyond that, you need to manage
                  consistency for data across all the nodes in your
                  replication group.
              </p>
        <p>
                    When you commit a transaction on the Master, your
                    Replica nodes may or may not have the data changes
                    performed by that transaction at the end of the commit.
                    Whether they do depends on how high a durability
                    guarantee you implemented for your Master (see the
                    previous section). If, for example, you configured your
                    Master to require acknowledgements from all electable
                    nodes before returning from the commit, then the data
                    will be consistently available across all of those nodes
                    in the replication group, although not necessarily by
                    secondary nodes. However, if you configured the Master
                    such that no acknowledgements are necessary, then your
                    data is probably not consistent across the replication
                    group.
              </p>
        <p>
                  To ensure that read transactions on the Replicas see a
                  sufficiently consistent view of the environment, you can
                  set a consistency policy for each transaction. This
                  policy describes how current the Replica must be before a
                  transaction can be initiated on it. If the Replica is not
                  current enough, the start of the transaction is delayed
                  until the Replica has caught up.
              </p>
        <p>
                  There are two possible consistency policies. First, there
                  is a time-based policy that describes how far back in
                  time the Replica is allowed to lag behind the Master.
                  Secondly, you can use a commit-based consistency
                  policy that is based on the commit of a specified
                  transaction. This policy is used to ensure the Replica is
                  at least current enough to have the changes made by a
                  specific transaction, and by all transactions committed
                  prior to the specified transaction. The start of a
                  transaction on a Replica can be delayed until the Replica
                  can meet the consistency policy defined for that transaction.
              </p>
        <p>
                  This means that a stringent consistency policy can affect
                  your Replica's read throughput.  Transactions, even
                  read-only transactions, cannot begin until the Replica is
                  consistent <span class="emphasis"><em>enough</em></span>. So if you have a
                  Replica that has lagged far behind the Master, and which
                  is having trouble catching up due to network latency or
                  other issues, then read requests may stall, and perhaps
                  even time out, which will affect the latency of your
                  Replica's read requests, and perhaps even its
                  overall availability for read requests.  For this reason,
                  give careful consideration to how well you want your
                  Replica to perform on reads, versus how consistent you
                  want the Replica to be with other nodes in the
                  replication group.
