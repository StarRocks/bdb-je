            Usage of JE HA requires you to handle many different
            HA-specific exceptions. While some of these are Master-specific
            and others are Replica-specific, your code may still need to
            handle both. The reason why is that it is not uncommon for HA
            applications to have standard classes that perform database
            access, regardless of whether the class is used for a node in
            the Master state or a node in the Replica state.
        </p>
      <p>
            The following class is an example class that can be used to
            perform transactional reads and writes in an HA application.
            This class is used by the on-disk HA examples that you can find
            in your JE distribution (see <a class="xref" href="repexample.html" title="Chapter 6. Replication Examples">Replication Examples</a> for more information). However, we
            think this particular example class is important enough that we
            also describe it here.
        </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

        <p>
                The <code class="classname">RunTransaction</code> abstract class is
                used to implement a utility class that performs database access
                for HA applications.  It provides all the
                transaction error handling and retry framework that
                is required for database access in an HA environment.
            </p>
        <p>
                Because <code class="classname">RunTransaction</code> is a class that
                is meant to be used by different example HA applications, it
                does not actually implement the database operations. Instead,
                it provides an abstract method that must be implemented by the
                HA application that uses <code class="classname">RunTransaction</code>.
            </p>
        <p>
                We begin by importing the classes that
                <code class="classname">RunTransaction</code> uses.
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">package je.rep.quote;

import java.io.PrintStream;

import com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentFailureException;
import com.sleepycat.je.LockConflictException;
import com.sleepycat.je.OperationFailureException;
import com.sleepycat.je.Transaction;
import com.sleepycat.je.rep.InsufficientAcksException;
import com.sleepycat.je.rep.InsufficientReplicasException;
import com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicaConsistencyException;
import com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicaWriteException;
import com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicatedEnvironment;</pre>
        <p>
            Then we define a series of private data members that identify how
            our HA transactions are going to behave in the event of an error
            condition.
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">abstract class RunTransaction {

    /* The maximum number of times to retry the transaction. */
    private static final int TRANSACTION_RETRY_MAX = 10;

    /*
     * The number of seconds to wait between retries when a sufficient
     * number of replicas are not available for a transaction.
     */
    private static final int INSUFFICIENT_REPLICA_RETRY_SEC = 1;

    /* Amount of time to wait to let a replica catch up before 
     * retrying. 
     */
    private static final int CONSISTENCY_RETRY_SEC = 1;

    /* Amount of time to wait after a lock conflict. */
    private static final int LOCK_CONFLICT_RETRY_SEC = 1;

    private final ReplicatedEnvironment env;
    private final PrintStream out; </pre>
        <p>
            Then we implement our class constructor, which is very simple
            because all the heavy lifting is done by whatever application calls
            this utility class.
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">    RunTransaction(ReplicatedEnvironment repEnv, 
                   PrintStream printStream) {
        env = repEnv;
        out = printStream;
    } </pre>
        <p>
            Now we implement our <code class="methodname">run()</code>
            method. This is what actually performs all the error checking and
            retry work for the class.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code class="methodname">run()</code> method catches the exceptions
            most likely to occur as we are reading and writing the database,
            and then handles them, but it will also throw
            <a class="ulink" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/InterruptedException.html" target="_top">InterruptedException</a> and <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentFailureException.html" target="_top">EnvironmentFailureException</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a class="ulink" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/InterruptedException.html" target="_top">InterruptedException</a> can be thrown if the thread calling this
            method is sleeping and some other thread interrupts it. The
            exception is possible because this method calls <a class="ulink" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#sleep(long)" target="_top">Thread.sleep</a> in
            the retry cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentFailureException.html" target="_top">EnvironmentFailureException</a> can occur both when beginning a
            transaction and also when committing a transaction. It means that
            there is something significantly wrong with the node's environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code class="literal">readOnly</code> parameter for this method is
            used to indicate that the transaction will only perform
            database reads. When that happens, the durability guarantee for
            the transaction is changed to <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/Durability.html#READ_ONLY_TXN" target="_top">Durability.READ_ONLY_TXN</a>
            because that policy does not call for any acknowledgements.
            This eliminates the possibility of an
            <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/InsufficientReplicasException.html" target="_top">InsufficientReplicasException</a> being thrown from the
            <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/Environment.html#beginTransaction(com.sleepycat.je.Transaction, com.sleepycat.je.TransactionConfig)" target="_top">Environment.beginTransaction()</a> operation.
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
    public void run(boolean readOnly)
        throws InterruptedException, EnvironmentFailureException { </pre>
        <p>
            Now we begin our retry loop and define our sleep cycle between
            retries. Initially, we do not actually sleep before
            retrying the transaction. However, some of the 
            error conditions caught by this method will cause the thread to
            sleep before the operation is retried. After every sleep operation,
            the sleep time is returned to 0 because usually putting the thread
            to sleep is of no benefit.
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">        OperationFailureException exception = null;
        boolean success = false;
        long sleepMillis = 0;
        final TransactionConfig txnConfig = readOnly ?
         new TransactionConfig().setDurability(Durability.READ_ONLY_TXN) :
         null;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; TRANSACTION_RETRY_MAX; i++) {
            /* Sleep before retrying. */
            if (sleepMillis != 0) {
                Thread.sleep(sleepMillis);
                sleepMillis = 0;
             } </pre>
        <p>
            Now we create our transaction, perform the database operations, and
            then do the work. The <code class="methodname">doTransactionWork()</code>
            method is an abstract method that must be implemented by the
            application using this class. Otherwise, this is standard
            transaction begin/commit code that should hold no surprises for
            you.
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">            Transaction txn = null;
            try {
                txn = env.beginTransaction(null, null);
                doTransactionWork(txn); /* CALL APP-SPECIFIC CODE */
                txn.commit();
                success = true;
                return; </pre>
        <p>
             The first error case that we check for is
             <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/InsufficientReplicasException.html" target="_top">InsufficientReplicasException</a>. This exception means that the
             Master is not in contact with enough Electable Replicas to successfully
             commit the transaction. It is possible that Replicas are still
             starting up after an application restart, so we put the thread to
             sleep before attempting the transaction again.
         </p>
        <p>
             <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/InsufficientReplicasException.html" target="_top">InsufficientReplicasException</a> is thrown by <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/Transaction.html#commit()" target="_top">Transaction.commit()</a>,
             so we do have to perform the transaction all over again.
         </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">            } catch (InsufficientReplicasException insufficientReplicas) {

              Next we check for <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/InsufficientAcksException.html" target="_top">InsufficientAcksException</a>. This exception
              means that the transaction has successfully committed on the
              Master, but not enough Electable Replicas have acknowledged the commit
              within the allowed period of time. Whether you consider this to
              be a successful commit depends on your durability policy.
          </p>
        <p>
              As provided here, the code considers this situation to be
              an unsuccessful commit. But if you have a lot of Electable Replicas and you
              have a strong durability guarantee on the Master, then you might
              be able to still consider this to be a successful commit. If so,
              you should set <code class="literal">success = true;</code> before
              returning from the method.

            exception can be thrown when the transaction begins. It means that
            the <code class="methodname">beginTransaction()</code> method has waited
            too long for the Replica to catch up relative to the Master. This
            situation does not really represent a failed transaction because
            the transaction never had a chance to proceed in the first place.

        <p>
            In any case, the proper thing to do is to put the thread to sleep

            consistency requirements. Then we retry the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that at this point in time, the transaction handle is in
            whatever state it was in when <code class="methodname">beginTransaction()</code>
            was called. If the handle was in the null state before
            attempting the operation, then it will still be in the null
            state. The important thing to realize here is that the

            Having done that, the class is almost completed. Left to do is to
            define a couple of methods, one of which is an abstract method
            that must be implemented by the application that uses this
            class.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code class="methodname">doTransactionWork()</code> is an abstract method
            where the actual database operations are performed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code class="methodname">onReplicaWrite()</code> is a method that should be
            implemented by the HA application that uses this class. It is used to 
            define whatever action the Replica should
            take if a write is attempted on it. For examples of how this is
            used, see the next section.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this implementation of the class, we simply throw
            the <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/ReplicaWriteException.html" target="_top">ReplicaWriteException</a> that got us here in the first place.
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">    abstract void doTransactionWork(Transaction txn);

    void onReplicaWrite(ReplicaWriteException replicaWrite) {
        throw replicaWrite;
    } </pre>
        <p>
            Finally, we implement <code class="methodname">onRetryFailure()</code>,
            which is what this class does if the transaction retry loop 
            goes through too many iterations. Here, we simply print the error
            to the console. A more robust application should probably write the
            error to the application logs.
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">    void onRetryFailure(OperationFailureException lastException) {
            out.println("Failed despite retries." +
                                ((lastException == null) ?
                                  "" :

                Having implemented the <code class="classname">RunTransaction</code> class, it is fairly easy to use. 
                Essentially, you only have to implement the
                <code class="methodname">RunTransaction.doTransactionWork()</code>
                method so that it performs whatever database access you
                want.
            </p>
        <p>
                For example, the following method performs a read on an
                <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/persist/EntityStore.html" target="_top">EntityStore</a> used by the <a class="ulink" href="../examples/je/rep/quote/StockQuotes.html" target="_top">StockQuotes</a> example HA
                application. Notice that the class is instantiated,
                <code class="methodname">doTransactionWork()</code> is
                implemented, and the <code class="methodname">RunTransaction.run()</code>
                method are all called in one place. This makes for fairly
                easy maintenance of the code.
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">    private void printStocks(final PrintStream out)
        throws InterruptedException {

        new RunTransaction(repEnv, out) {

            @Override

                // dao is a DataAccessor class used to access
                // an entity store.

        <p>
                In the previous example, we do not bother to override the 
                <code class="methodname">RunTransaction.onReplicaWrite()</code>
                method because this transaction is performing read-only
                access to the database. Regardless of whether the
                transaction is run on a Master or a Replica,
                <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/ReplicaWriteException.html" target="_top">ReplicaWriteException</a> can not be raised here, so we can
                safely use the default implementation.
            </p>
        <p>
                However, if we were running a transaction that performs a
                database write, then we should probably do something with 
                <code class="methodname">onReplicaWrite()</code> other than merely
                re-throwing the exception.
            </p>

                The following is an example usage of
                <code class="classname">RunTransaction</code> that is also used in
