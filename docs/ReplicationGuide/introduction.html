    This book provides a thorough introduction to
    replication as used with Berkeley DB, Java Edition (JE). It begins by offering a
    general overview to replication and the benefits it provides. It also
    describes the APIs that you use to implement replication, and it
    describes architecturally the things that you need to do to your
    application code in order to use the replication APIs. 
  </p>
      <p>
    You should understand the concepts from the <em class="citetitle">Berkeley DB, Java Edition Getting Started with Transaction Processing</em>
     guide before reading this book.

            Welcome to the JE High Availability (HA) product. JE HA
            is a replicated, single-master, embedded database engine based
            on Berkeley DB, Java Edition.  JE HA offers important improvements in
            application availability, as well as offering improved read
            scalability and performance. JE HA does this by extending
            the data guarantees offered by a traditional transactional
            system to processes running on multiple physical hosts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JE replication APIs allow you to distribute your
            database contents (performed on a read-write Master) to one or 
            more read-only <span class="emphasis"><em>Replicas</em></span>.  
            For this reason, JE's replication implementation is said to be a
            <span class="emphasis"><em>single master, multiple replica</em></span> replication strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Replication offers your application a number of benefits that
            can be a tremendous help. Primarily, replication's benefits
            revolve around performance, but there is also a benefit in
            terms of data durability guarantees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Briefly, some of the reasons why you might choose to implement
            replication in your JE application are:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                       Improved application availability.
               </p>
              <p>
                       By spreading your data across multiple
                       machines, you can ensure that your
                       application's data continues to be
                       available even in the event of a
                       hardware failure on any given machine in
                       the replication group.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    Improve read performance.
                </p>
              <p>
                    By using replication you can spread data reads across
                    multiple machines on your network. Doing so allows you
                    to vastly improve your application's read performance.
                    This strategy might be particularly interesting for
                    applications that have readers on remote network nodes;
                    you can push your data to the network's edges thereby
                    improving application data read responsiveness.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                   Improve transactional commit performance
                </p>
              <p>
                   In order to commit a transaction and achieve a
                   transactional durability guarantee, the commit must be
                   made <span class="emphasis"><em>durable</em></span>. That is, the commit
                   must be written to disk (usually, but not always,
                   synchronously) before the application's thread of
                   control can continue operations.
                </p>
              <p>
                    Replication allows you to batch disk I/O so that it is
                    performed as efficiently as possible while still
                    maintaining a degree of durability by <span class="emphasis"><em>committing
                    to the network</em></span>. In other words, you relax
                    your transactional durability guarantees on the machine
                    where you perform the database write,
                    but by virtue of replicating the data across the
                    network you gain some additional durability guarantees
                    beyond what is provided locally. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                   Improve data durability guarantee.        
                </p>
              <p>
                    In a traditional transactional application, you commit your
                    transactions such that data modifications are saved to
                    disk. Beyond this, the durability of your data is
                    dependent upon the backup strategy that you choose to
                    implement for your site.
                </p>
              <p>
                    Replication allows you to increase this durability
                    guarantee by ensuring that data modifications are
                    written to multiple machines. This means that multiple
                    disks, disk controllers, power supplies, and CPUs are
                    used to ensure that your data modification makes it to
                    stable storage. In other words, replication allows you
                    to minimize the problem of a single point of failure
                    by using more hardware to guarantee your data writes.
                </p>
              <p>
                    If you are using replication for this reason, then you
                    probably will want to configure your application such
                    that it waits to hear about a successful commit from 
                    one or more replicas before continuing with the next
                    operation. This will obviously impact your
                    application's write performance to some degree 
                    — with the performance penalty being largely dependent
                    upon the speed and stability of the network connecting
                    your replication group.

                Processes that take part in a JE HA application are
                generically called <span class="emphasis"><em>nodes</em></span>. Most nodes
                serve as a read-only Replica. One node in the HA
                application can perform database writes. This is the Master node.
            </p>
          <p>
                The sum totality of all the nodes taking part in the
                replicated application is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>replication
                    group</em></span>. While it is only a logical entity
                (there is no object that you instantiate and destroy which
                represents the replication group), the replication group is
                the first-order element of management for a replicated HA
                application. It is very important to remember that the
                replication group is persistent in that it exists
                regardless of whether its member nodes are currently
                running. In fact, nodes that have been added to a replication
                group (with the exception of Secondary nodes) will remain in
                the group until they are manually removed from the group by
                you or your application's administrator.
            </p>
          <p>
                Replication groups consist of electable nodes and,
                optionally, Monitor and Secondary nodes.
            </p>
          <p>
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Electable</em></span> nodes are replication group
              members that can be elected to become the group's Master node
              through a <span class="emphasis"><em>replication election</em></span>.  Electable
              nodes are also the group members that vote in these elections.
              If an electable node is not a Master, then it serves in the
              replication group as a read-only Replica. Electable nodes have
              access to a JE environment, and are persistent members of
              the replication group.  Electable nodes that are Replicas also
              participate in transaction durability decisions by providing the
              master with acknowledgments of transaction commits.
            </p>
          <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p>
                    Beyond Master and Replica, a node can also be in 
                    several other states. See
                    <a class="xref" href="lifecycle.html" title="Replication Group Life Cycle">Replication Group Life Cycle</a>

          </div>
          <p>
                Most of the nodes in a replication group are electable
                nodes, but it is possible to have nodes of the other types
                as well.
            </p>
          <p>
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Secondary nodes</em></span> also have access to a
                JE environment, but can only serve as read-only replicas,
                not masters, and do not participate in elections.  Secondary
                nodes can be used to provide read-only data access from
                locations with higher latency network connections to the rest
                of the replication group without introducing communication
                delays into elections. Secondary nodes are not persistent
                members of the replication group; they are only considered
                members when they are connected to the current master.
                Secondary nodes do not participate in transaction durability
                decisions.

                <span class="emphasis"><em>Monitor nodes</em></span> do not have access to a
                JE environment and do not participate in elections. For
                this reason, they cannot serve as either a Master or a
                Replica. Instead, they merely monitor the composition of the
                replication group as changes are made by adding and removing
                electable nodes, joining and leaving of electable and
                secondary nodes, and as elections are held to select a new
                Master. Monitor nodes are therefore used by applications
                external to the JE replicated application to route data
                requests to the various members of the replication
                group. Monitor nodes are persistent members of the
                replication group. Monitor nodes do not participate in
                transaction durability decisions.
            </p>
          <p>
                Note that all nodes in a replication group have a unique
                group-wide name. Further, all replication groups are also
                assigned a unique name. This is necessary because it is
                possible for a single process to have access to multiple
                replication groups. Further, any given collection of
                hardware can be running multiple replication groups (a
                production and a test group, for example.) By uniquely
                identifying the replication group with a unique name, it is
                possible for JE HA to internally check that nodes have
                not been misconfigured and so make sure that messages are
                being routed to the correct location.

                All electable and secondary nodes must have access to a
                database environment. Further, no node can share a database
                environment with another node.
            </p>
          <p>
                More to the point, in order to create an electable or
                secondary node in a replication group, you use a
                specialized form of the environment handle:

                There is no JE-specified limit to the number of
                environments which can join a replication group.
                The only limitation here is one of resources —
                network bandwidth, for example.

          <p>
                    Every replication group is allowed one and only one
                    Master. Masters are selected by
                    holding an <span class="emphasis"><em>election</em></span>.  All such
                    elections are performed by the underlying Berkeley DB, Java Edition
                    replication code.
                </p>
          <p>
                    When a node joins a replication group, it attempts to
                    locate the Master. If it is the first electable node added
                    to the replication group, then it automatically becomes
                    the Master. If it is an electable node, but is not the
                    first to startup in the replication group and it cannot
                    locate the Master, it calls for an election. Further, if
                    at any time the Master becomes unavailable to the
                    replication group, the electable replicas will call for an
                    election.
                </p>
          <p>
                    When holding an election, election participants vote on
                    who should be the Master. Among the electable nodes
                    participating in the election, the node with the most
                    up-to-date set of logs will win the election. In order
                    to win an election, a node must win a simple majority
                    of the votes.
                </p>
          <p>
                    Usually JE requires a majority of electable nodes to be
                    available to hold an election. If a simple majority is
                    not available, then the replication group will no
                    longer be able to accept write requests as there will
                    be no Master.
                </p>
          <p>
                    Note that an electable node is part of the replication
                    group even if it is currently not running or is
                    otherwise unreachable by the rest of the replication
                    group. Membership of electable nodes in the replication
                    group is persistent; once an electable node joins the
                    group, it remains in the group regardless of its current
                    state. The only way an electable node leaves a
                    replication group is if you manually remove it from the
                    group (see
                    <a class="xref" href="utilities.html#node-addremove" title="Adding and Removing Nodes from the Group">Adding and Removing Nodes from the Group</a>
                    for details). This is a very important point to remember
                    when considering elections. <span class="emphasis"><em>An election cannot be held
                    if the majority of electable nodes in the group are not
                    running or are otherwise unreachable.</em></span>

            <p>
                        There are two circumstances under which a majority
                        of electable nodes need not be available in order
                        to hold an election. The first is for the special
                        circumstance of the two-node group. See <a class="xref" href="two-node.html" title="Configuring Two-Node Groups">Configuring Two-Node Groups</a> for
                        details.
                    </p>
            <p>
                        The second circumstance is if you explicitly relax
                        the requirement for a majority of electable nodes to
                        be available in order to hold an election. This is a
                        dangerous thing to do, and your replication group
                        should rarely (if ever) be configured this way. See
                        <a class="xref" href="election-override.html" title="Appendix A. Managing a Failure of the Majority">Managing a Failure of the Majority</a>

          </div>
          <p>
                    Once a node has been elected Master, it remains in that
                    role until the replication group has a reason to hold
                    another election. Currently, the only reason why the group
                    will try to elect a new Master is if the current Master
                    becomes unavailable to the group. This can happen 
                    because you shutdown the current Master, the current Master
                    crashes due to bugs in your application code, or a network
                    outage causes the current Master to be unreachable by a
                    majority of the electable nodes in your replication group.
                </p>
          <p>
                    In the event of a tie in the number of votes, JE's
                    underlying implementation of the election code will
                    pick the Master. Moreover, the election code will
                    always make a consistent choice when settling a tie.
                    That is, all things being even, the same node will
                    always be picked to win a tied election.

          <p>
                Write transactions can only be performed at the Master.
                The results of these transactions are replicated to
                Replicas using a logical replication stream.
            </p>
          <p>
                Logical replication streams are performed over a TCP/IP
                connection. The stream contains a description of the
                logical changes (for example, insert, update or delete)
                operations that were performed on the database as a result
                of the transaction commit.  Each such replicated change is
                assigned a group-wide unique identifier called a Virtual
                Log Sequence Number (VLSN). The VLSN can be used to locate
                the replicated change in the log files associated with any
                member of the group.  Through the use of the VLSN, each
                operation described by the replication stream can be
                replayed at each Replica using an efficient internal replay
                mechanism.
            </p>
          <p>
                A consequence of this logical replaying of a transaction is
                that physical characteristics of the log files contained at
                the Replicas can be different across the replication group.
                The data contents of the environments found across the replication
                group, however, should be identical. 
            </p>
          <p>
                Note that there is a process by which a non-replicated
                environment can be converted such that it has the log
                structure and metadata required for replication. See
