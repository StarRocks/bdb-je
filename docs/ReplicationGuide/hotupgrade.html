      <p>
          After deploying a BDB JE HA application, you may later want to
          upgrade to a new version.  Berkeley DB JE supports hot upgrade of a
          replication group, by allowing mixed version operation.  That is,
          replication nodes running the newer software version can
          inter-operate with older version nodes and both can be available for
          user operations.  However, in some cases, there are certain
          constraints to performing such a hot upgrade.
      </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
                Each release of Berkeley DB JE is tied to a given log file
                on-disk format. Log file formats do not necessarily change
                every release. The Change Log for each release specifies
                whether the log file format has changed or not. There are
                no restrictions on upgrades across releases that use the
                same log file format. For best performance and to take
                advantage of bug fixes, ensure all nodes in a replication
                group run with the same BDB JE version during normal
                operations.  Occasionally, a new release of Berkeley DB JE
                includes a log file format change. The constraints that
                apply to upgrades which introduce new log file formats are
                explained in this section.
            </p>
        <p>
                In a replication group, the Master transmits log records that
                must be read by the replicas. If a group is operating with
                mixed version nodes, the Master must be running a version of
                JE that is older than, equal to, or (by default) no more
                than one version greater than the replicas. This is required
                so that the Master can supply the replicas with a version of
                the replication stream that they can understand.
            </p>
        <p>
                Note that some releases may support online upgrades with
                replicas running versions that are more than one log file
                format version different from each other. But any such
                additional flexibility will be called out in the release
                notes.
            </p>
        <p>
                To support the versioning requirement, make sure to upgrade
                all nodes to the version with the next log file format before
                upgrading any nodes to a still later log file format. If you
                cannot meet this restriction, then a hot upgrade should be
                performed. Instead, all nodes in the replication group should
                be taken offline and upgraded before any are restarted.
            </p>
        <p>
                The recommended steps for upgrading Berkeley DB JE HA when
                log file formats have changed are as follows:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        Determine if the upgrade skips any log file format
                        versions. If it has, and it is not possible to
                        upgrade to the intermediate versions, then plan to
                        perform an offline upgrade.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Bring all Replicas up to date with the Master. That
                        is, all Replicas must have the same environment
                        content as the Master. You can ascertain this by
                        using the <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/util/DbGroupAdmin.html#dumpGroup()(com.sleepycat.je.rep.util.DbGroupAdmin)" target="_top">DbGroupAdmin.dumpGroup()</a> utility, or
                        programmatically using the
                        <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/ReplicaConsistencyPolicy.html" target="_top">ReplicaConsistencyPolicy</a>.
                    </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                        Perform the following upgrade procedures on each of
                        the environments that are part of the replication
                        group.

                        Upgrade each individual data node, both Replicas and

                        group.

            There are exceptions that you may run into during the upgrade
            process.  The following exceptions may be thrown when a
            replication group node is restarted during the upgrade, and a
            ReplicatedEnvironment object is instantiated:
          </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/RollbackException.html" target="_top">RollbackException</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                    This exception can be thrown by a Replica when its log
                    is ahead of the current Master and the Replica is
                    unable to rollback without a recovery. As a
                    consequence, one or more of the most recently committed
                    transactions may need to be rolled back, before the
                    Replica can synchronize its state with that of the
                    current Master. This exception can also be thrown if
                    the current Master crashes.  To solve this exception
                    restart the ReplicatedEnvironment with the new JE
                    version.
                </p>
            </li>

                </p>
              <p>
                    During synchronization, a Replica that has a newer log,
                    may have to roll back a number of committed
                    tranactions.  If the number of rolled back transactions
                    exceeds the limit defined by <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/ReplicationConfig.html#TXN_ROLLBACK_LIMIT" target="_top">TXN_ROLLBACK_LIMIT</a>, the
                    Replica throws a RollbackProhibitedException.  To solve
                    this exception you may have to truncate logs manually
                    by using DbTruncateLog and restart the
                    ReplicatedEnvironment with the new JE version.

                </p>
              <p>
                    EnvironmentFailureException is thrown due to log
                    version incompatibility between the Master and the
                    Replica.  This exception is thrown with the message: 
                </p>
              <p>
                    "Incompatible log versions. Feeder log version: xxxx,

                </p>
              <p>
                    To solve this exception restart the
