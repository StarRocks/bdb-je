      This chapter describes issues pertaining to running a JE
      replication application. The topics discussed here have to do with
      hardware configuration, backups, node configuration, and other
      management issues that exist once the application has been
      placed into production.
  </p>
      <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="hardware"></a>Hardware</h2>

        <p>
          A JE replicated application should run well on typical
          commodity multi-core hardware, although greater hardware
          requirements than this may be driven by the architecture of your
          particular application. Check with the software developers who
          wrote your JE replicated application for any additional
          requirements they may have over and above typical
          multi-core hardware.
      </p>
        <p>
          That said, keep the following in mind when putting a JE
          replication application into production:
      </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                  Examine the hardware you intend to use, and review it for
                  common points of failure between nodes in the replication
                  groups, such as shared power supplies, routers and so
                  forth.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                  The hardware that you use does not have to be identical
                  across the entire production hardware. However, it is
                  important to ensure that the least capable electable node
                  has the resources to function as the Master.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Master is typically the node where demand for machine
                  resources is the greatest. It needs to supply the
                  replication streams for each active Replica, in addition
                  to servicing the transaction load.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Note that JE requires Monitor nodes to have minimal 
                  resource consumption (although, again, your application
                  developers may have written your Monitor nodes such that
                  they need resources over and above what JE requires),
                  because Monitor nodes only listen for changes in the
                  replication group.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                  Finally, your network is a critical part of your hardware
                  requirements. It is critical that your network be capable
                  of delivering adequate throughput under peak expected
                  production work loads.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Remember that your replicated application can consume
                  quite a lot of network resources when a Replica starts up
                  for the first time, or starts up after being shutdown for
                  a long time. This is because the Replica must obtain all
                  the data that it needs to operate. Essentially, this is a
                  duplicate of the data contained by the Master node. So
                  however much data the Master node holds, that much data
                  will be transmitted across your network <span class="emphasis"><em>per
                      node</em></span> every time you start a new node.
              </p>
              <p>
                  For restarting nodes, the amount of data that will cross
                  your network is equal to the delta between the time the
                  Replica last shutdown and the state of your Master node
                  at the time that the Replica is starting up again. If the
                  Replica has been down for a long time (days or weeks),
                  this can be quite a lot of data, depending on your Master
                  node's workload.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Be aware, however, that restarting nodes do not have to
                  get their data from the Master node. It is possible for
                  them to catch up, or nearly catch up, using data obtained
                  from some other currently running Replica. See 
                  <a class="xref" href="logfile-restore.html" title="Restoring Log Files">Restoring Log Files</a> 
                  for more information.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Good application performance also depends on the
                  latency of network connections used by electable and
                  monitor nodes to perform elections, report election
                  results, and obtain acknowledgments. Consider
                  deploying secondary nodes on machines with higher
                  latency connections to the other members of the
                  replication group, keeping in mind that these nodes
                  still have the same throughput requirements as
                  electable nodes.
