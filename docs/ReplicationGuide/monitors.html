      <p>
       So far in this book we have mostly discussed electable and
       secondary nodes, which are by definition nodes that have access
       to a JE <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/ReplicatedEnvironment.html" target="_top">ReplicatedEnvironment</a>. However, replication groups
       can include any number of nodes that have no access to the JE
       replicated environment in use by the replication group.
   </p>
      <p>
       These type of nodes without environments are called
       <span class="emphasis"><em>monitor nodes</em></span>. The point of a monitor node
       is to allow a process to have some understanding of the
       replication group's structure such as which node is the Master
       and what nodes belong to the group as Replicas. Monitor nodes
       also have the ability to know when certain events have happened
       in the replication group, such as when a new Master is elected or
       when new nodes are added to, or removed from, the group.
   </p>
      <p>
       There are many uses for Monitor nodes, starting with the ability to
       write processes that monitor the current status of your HA
       application. But another, arguably more interesting, use for
       Monitor nodes is for request routing. As we have explained earlier
       in this book, Replicas can only service read-only requests; all
       write requests must occur on the Master. However, Replicas are only
       capable of noticing that they have been asked to process a write
       request. At most, out of the box, they can complain about it by
       throwing a <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/ReplicaWriteException.html" target="_top">ReplicaWriteException</a>, and then completely rejecting
       the request.
   </p>
      <p>
       One way to handle this problem is by writing an request router that
       sits on your network between the data nodes and your clients.
       This router can send write requests to the Master, and read
       requests to the Replicas. A robust example of this sort of thing
       could also perform load balancing across the various Replicas, so
       that no one Replica becomes swamped by too many read requests.

        <p>
           You implement Monitor nodes using the <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/monitor/Monitor.html" target="_top">Monitor</a> class. The
           <code class="classname">Monitor</code> class allows you to obtain
           information about the replication group, such as its name,
           where the Master is, and other such information. The
           <code class="classname">Monitor</code> class also allows you to run an
           event listener that can alert you to changes in the composition
           of the replication group.
       </p>
        <p>
           You instantiate a <code class="classname">Monitor</code> class object
           in much the same way as you instantiate a
           <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/ReplicatedEnvironment.html" target="_top">ReplicatedEnvironment</a> class object. It is necessary to give
           the node a name, to indicate that it is a Monitor node, to
           identify the node's host and port information, and to identify
           helper hosts. You use a <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/monitor/MonitorConfig.html" target="_top">MonitorConfig</a> object to do these
           things.
       </p>
        <p>
           Once the <code class="classname">Monitor</code> object has been
           instantiated, it must be registered at least once with the
           Master so that the replication group will know to keep the node
           informed about changes in the group composition. (Subsequent
           attempts to register the node are simply ignored by the
           Master.) You use the <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/monitor/Monitor.html#register()" target="_top">Monitor.register()</a> method to register a
           Monitor node with a Master. 
       </p>
        <p>
           For example:
       </p>
        <pre class="programlisting"> // Initialize the monitor node config
MonitorConfig config = new MonitorConfig();
config.setGroupName("MyRepGroupName");
config.setNodeName("mon1");
config.setNodeHostPort("monhost1.acme.com:7000");
config.setHelperHosts("node1.acme.com:5000,node2.acme.com:5000");

Monitor monitor = new Monitor(config);

// If the monitor has not been registered as a member of the 
// group, register it now. register() returns the current node 
// that is the master.
ReplicationNode currentMaster = monitor.register(); </pre>
