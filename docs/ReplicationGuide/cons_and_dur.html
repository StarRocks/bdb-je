            As discussed throughout this chapter, there is an interaction
            between consistency and durability. This interaction results in
            design decisions that you will have to make when designing your
            HA application. To further illustrate this interaction, this
            section provides several use cases as examples of how
            durability and consistency policies are used to reach
            application design goals.

                <span class="emphasis"><em>Out on the Town</em></span> is a social networking
                site about restaurants and artistic events. Restaurant
                locations and an event calendar are available on the site.
                Members can submit reviews about restaurants and events,
                and other members can comment on the reviews. Further,
                members maintain accounts and profiles.
            </p>
        <p>
                The site experiences most of its traffic as read-only
                requests. There is heavy read traffic from users who are
                browsing the site. In addition, periodic write traffic
                occurs as reviews and comments are submitted to the site.

                    Based on the site's usage characteristics, the web developers 
                    know that it is critical that the site perform well for read traffic.
                    Listings must be readily available, and the site must be
                    able to adapt to changing read loads. However, the site
                    only needs a low threshold for most reads.
                </p>
          <p>
                    While users should not experience a delay when they
                    access the site, it is okay if read requests do not see
                    the very latest reviews. For this reason, when starting
                    read-only transactions for the purpose of viewing
                    reviews, the application specifies a consistency policy
                    of <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/NoConsistencyRequiredPolicy.html" target="_top">NoConsistencyRequiredPolicy</a>. This provides the highest
                    possible availability for read requests for the Replica 
                    nodes, which is the critical thing for this particular
                    site. (Any other consistency policy might cause the
                    node to delay reads while waiting for the node to meet
                    its consistency policy, which would represent an
                    unacceptable loss of availability as it could cost the
                    site lost readership.)

                    Most write operations are for new user reviews, and for comments on those
                    reviews. For these writes, the application needs only a very lenient durability
                    policy.  It is not critical that a new review is immediately
                    available to other users, nor is it critical that they are saved in the event of
                    a catastrophic failure.
                </p>
          <p>
                    Therefore, the application uses the convenience
                    constant <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/Durability.html#COMMIT_WRITE_NO_SYNC" target="_top">Durability.COMMIT_WRITE_NO_SYNC</a> as the system default durability
                    policy. (This is done by specifying the durability policy using
                    <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentMutableConfig.html#setDurability(com.sleepycat.je.Durability)" target="_top">EnvironmentMutableConfig.setDurability()</a>.) This means:

                            Only a simple majority of the Electable nodes need to acknowledge the

                    Periodically, the calendar of events and restaurant locations are updated. These
                    write operations happen fairly infrequently relative to reviews and comments,
                    but the site's operators deem this information to be of more importance (or
                    valuable) than the reviews and comments. Therefore, they want a stronger
                    guarantee that the information is backed up to all nodes, which is the same
                    thing as saying they want a stronger durability guarantee. Nevertheless, they
                    also want this class of writes to consume few resources.
                </p>
          <p>
                    To achieve this, for transactions performing these kind of writes, the web
                    engineers choose to override the site's default durability guarantee. Instead,
                    they use a durability guarantee that:

          <div class="itemizedlist">

                <p>

                            This ensures that the write is fully backed up to the Master's local
                            disk before the transaction commit operation returns.

                            policy on the Replica nodes. This causes the updates to be written to
                            the disk controller's buffers, but they are not flushed to disk before
                            the Electable Replicas acknowledge the commit operation.

                    That is, for updating events and restaurant locations, the application uses this

                    If a user makes an account profile change as part of a
                    web session, she will naturally expect to see her
                    changes when she next looks at the profile during the
                    same session. From the user's perspective, this is all
                    one operation: she causes her profile to change and
                    then the profile page is refreshed with her new
                    information.
                </p>
          <p>
                    However, from the application's perspective, there are

                            A write transaction is performed on the Master.

                <p>
                            One or more read transactions are performed on the
                            Replica node in use by the user as she updates
                            her profile and then reads back the changes she
                            just made.

          </div>
          <p>
                    To ensure that the session interaction looks
                    intuitively consistent to the user, the application:
                </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p>
                            Performs the write transaction on the Master.
                        </p>

                            Saves the <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/CommitToken.html" target="_top">CommitToken</a> for the account profile
                            update within the web session.

              <li>
                <p>
                            The Replica node uses a <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/CommitPointConsistencyPolicy.html" target="_top">CommitPointConsistencyPolicy</a> policy for the
                            follow-on account profile read(s). To do this, the application uses the
                            <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/CommitToken.html" target="_top">CommitToken</a> stored in the previous step when beginning the read
                            transactions. In this way, the Replica will not serve up the new profile
                            page until it has received the profile updates from the Master. From the
                            user's perspective, there may be a delay in her page refresh when she
                            submits her updates. How long of a delay experienced by the user is a
                            function of how busy the site is with write updates, as well as the
                            performance characteristics of the hardware and networks in use by the
                            site.

          <p>
                    For an acknowledgement policy, the engineers
                    considered requiring all Electable nodes to
                    acknowledge the commit. This would provide them with the strongest possible
                    durability guarantee. However, they decided against this because it represents a
                    possible loss of write availability for the
                    application; if even one Electable node is
                    shutdown or hidden by a network outage, then the Master would not be able to
                    perform any write operations at all. So instead, the engineers stick with the
                    default acknowledgement policy, which is to require a simple majority of the
                    Electable nodes to acknowledge the commit.
                </p>

                    The durability policy, then, looks like this:
                </p>
          <pre class="programlisting">    resultsDurability = 
         new Durability(Durability.SyncPolicy.SYNC,
                        Durability.SyncPolicy.SYNC,
                        Durability.ReplicaAckPolicy.SIMPLE_MAJORITY); </pre>

                    The BioLabs application is required to monitor the production stream. All such
                    monitoring must be of data that is no older than a defined age.
                </p>
          <p>
                    This represents a read activity that has a time concurrency policy requirement.
                    Therefore, whenever the application performs a write (that is, logs sampling
                    results), the application creates a <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/CommitToken.html" target="_top">CommitToken</a>. Each of the nodes, then, use
                    this commit token to specify a <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/CommitPointConsistencyPolicy.html" target="_top">CommitPointConsistencyPolicy</a> policy when the 
                    <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/Environment.html#beginTransaction(com.sleepycat.je.Transaction, com.sleepycat.je.TransactionConfig)" target="_top">Environment.beginTransaction()</a> method is called. This guarantees that the
                    application's data monitoring activities will be performed on data that is not
                    out of date or stale.
