        An in-depth description of concurrent processing in JE is beyond the scope of this manual. However, there are
        a few things that you should be aware of as you explore JE. Note that many of these topics are described in
        greater detail in other parts of this book. This section is intended only to summarize JE concurrent
        processing.
    </p>
      <p>
            Also, this appendix touches on a topic not
            discussed in any detail in this manual: transactions. Transactional usage is
            optional but nevertheless very commonly used for JE
            applications, especially when writing multi-threaded or
            multi-process applications. However, transactions also
            represent a topic that is too large for this book. To read a
            thorough description of JE and transactional processing,
            see the <em class="citetitle">Berkeley DB, Java Edition Getting Started with Transaction Processing</em> guide.

            Note the following if you are writing an application that will use multiple threads for reading and writing
            JE databases:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                    JE database and environment handles are free-threaded (that is, are thread safe), so from a mechanical perspective you 
					do not have to synchronize access to them when they are used by multiple threads of control.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    It is dangerous to close environments and databases when other database operations are in
                    progress. So if you are going to share handles for these objects across threads, you should
                    architect your application such that there is no possibility of a thread closing a handle when
                    another thread is using that handle.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    If a transaction is shared across threads, it is safe to call <code class="methodname">transaction.abort()</code> from
                    any thread. However, be aware that any thread that attempts a database operation using an aborted
					transaction will throw a <code class="classname">DatabaseException</code>. You should architect your
					application such that your threads are able to gracefully deal with some other thread aborting the
					current transaction.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    If a transaction is shared across threads, make sure that
                    <code class="methodname">transaction.commit()</code> can never be called until all threads participating in
                    the transaction have completed their database operations.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    Locking is performed at the database record level.
                    JE always checks for lock conflicts, which can be caused either by operations that run for 
                    too long a period of time, or by deadlocks.  JE decides that a lock conflict has occured when
                    the lock cannot be obtained within a set timeout
                    period.  If it cannot, regardless of why the lock could
                    not be obtained, then <code class="classname">LockConflictException</code> is thrown.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    A non-transactional operation that reads a record locks it for the duration of the read. 
                    While locked for read, a write lock can not be obtained on that record. However, another read lock
                    can be obtained for that record. This means that for threaded applications, multiple threads can
                    simultaneously read a record, but no thread can write to the record while a read is in progress.
                </p>
              <p>
					Note that if you are performing uncommitted reads, then no locking is performed for that read. Instead,
					JE uses internal mechanisms to ensure that the data you are reading is consistent (that is, it
					will not change mid-read).
				</p>
              <p>
					Finally, it is possible to specify that you want a write lock for your read operation. You do this
					using <code class="literal">LockMode.RMW</code>. Use <code class="literal">RMW</code> when you know that your read will
					subsequently be followed up with a write operation. Doing so can help to avoid lock conflicts.
				</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    An operation that writes to a record obtains a write lock on that record. While the write lock is in
                    progress, no other locks can be obtained for that record (either read or write).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    All locks, read or write,  obtained from within a transaction are held until the transaction is either 
					committed or aborted.
                    This means that the longer a transaction lives, the more likely other threads in your application
                    are to run into lock conflicts. That is, write operations
                    performed outside of the scope of the transaction will not be able to obtain a lock on those records
                    while the transaction is in progress. Also, by default, reads performed outside the scope of the
                    transaction will not be able to lock records written by the transaction. However, this behavior can be
                    overridden by configuring your reader to perform uncommitted reads.
