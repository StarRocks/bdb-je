      <p>In Berkeley DB Java Edition, a database is a collection of <span class="emphasis"><em>records</em></span>. Records,
  in turn, consist of key/data pairings.
  </p>
      <p>
	Conceptually, you can think of a 
		<code class="classname">Database</code>
		 
	as containing a two-column table where column 1 contains a key and column 2
	contains data.  Both the key and the data are managed using 
		<code class="classname">DatabaseEntry</code> 
		
		
		<span>class instances</span>
		
	(see <a class="xref" href="DBEntry.html" title="Chapter 8. Database Records">Database Records</a> for details on this 
	    <span>class</span>
	    ).
	So, fundamentally, using a JE 
		<code class="classname">Database</code> 
		 
	involves putting, getting, and deleting database records, which in turns involves efficiently 
	managing information 
		<span>encapsulated by </span>
		
		
		<code class="classname">DatabaseEntry</code> 
		
		
		
		<span>objects.</span>
		
	The next several chapters of this book are dedicated to those activities.
  </p>
      <p>
	Note that on disk, databases are stored in sequentially numerically
    named log files in the directory where the opening 
	environment is located.  JE log files are described 
	<a class="xref" href="backuprestore.html#databaselogs" title="Databases and Log Files">Databases and Log Files</a>.
  </p>
      <p>
        Also, note that in the previous section of this book, <a class="xref" href="dpl.html" title="Part I. Programming with the Direct Persistence Layer">Programming with the Direct Persistence Layer</a>, 
        we described the DPL The DPL handles all database management
        for you, including creating all primary and secondary databases as is
        required by your application. That said, if you are using the DPL
        you can access the underlying database for a given index if
        necessary. See the Javadoc for the DPL for more information.

		You open a database by using the 
		<code class="methodname">Environment.openDatabase()</code>
    	method (environments are described in <a class="xref" href="env.html" title="Chapter 2. Database Environments">Database Environments</a>). This 
		method creates and returns a <code class="classname">Database</code> 
		object handle.
    	You must provide <code class="methodname">Environment.openDatabase()</code>
    	with a database name.
	</p>
        <p>
		You can optionally provide <code class="methodname">Environment.openDatabase()</code>
    	with a <code class="classname">DatabaseConfig()</code> object.
    	<code class="classname">DatabaseConfig()</code> allows you to set properties for
    	the database, such as whether it can be created if it does not currently
    	exist, whether you are opening it read-only, and whether the database is to support transactions.
	</p>
        <p>
		Note that by default, JE does not create databases if they do not already exist. 
		To override this behavior, set the <a class="link" href="dbprops.html" title="Database Properties">creation property</a> to true.
	</p>
        <p>
		Finally, if you configured your environment and database to support transactions,
		you can optionally provide a transaction object to the
    	<code class="methodname">Environment.openDatabase()</code>.
    	Transactions are described in the
        <em class="citetitle">Berkeley DB, Java Edition Getting Started with Transaction Processing</em> guide.

                By default, JE database operations that modify the
                database are written (logged) at the time of the operation.  For transactional
                databases, changes become durable when the transaction is committed.
        </p>
          <p>
                However, deferred write databases operations are not written at the time
                of the operation.  Writing is deferred for as long as possible.  The
                changes are only guaranteed to be durable after the 
                <code class="methodname">Database.sync()</code> method
                is called or the database is properly closed.
        </p>
          <p>
                Deferring writes in this manner has two performance advantages when performing
                database modifications:
        </p>
          <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                <p>
                                When multiple threads are performing writes, Concurrency is increased 
                                because the bottleneck of writing to the log is avoided.
                        </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                                Less total writing takes place.  If a single record is modified more
                                than once, or modified and deleted, then only the final result must
                                be written.  If a record is inserted and deleted before a
                                database sync or close occurs, nothing at all is written to disk.
                                The same advantage holds for writing internal index
                                information.
                        </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>
                Deferred write databases are useful for applications that perform a
                great deal of database modifications, record additions, deletions, and
                so forth. By delaying the data write, you delay the disk I/O. Depending
                on your workload, this can improve your data throughput by quite a lot.
        </p>
          <p>
                While the durability of a deferred write database is only
                <span class="emphasis"><em>guaranteed</em></span> when 
                <code class="methodname">Database.sync()</code>
                is called or the database is properly closed, writing may also occur at other times.
                For example, a JE checkpoint will effectively perform a 
                <code class="methodname">Database.sync()</code> on all deferred
                write databases that are open at the time of the checkpoint.  If you are
                using deferred write to load a large data set, and you want to reduce
                writing as much as possible during the load, consider disabling the JE checkpointer.
        </p>
          <p>
                Also, if the JE cache overflows as database modifications occur, information discarded
                from the cache is written to disk in order to avoid losing the changes. If you wish to reduce this
                writing to a minimum, configure your cache to be large enough to hold the entire
                data set being modified, or as large as possible.
        </p>
          <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p>
                Despite the examples noted in the previous paragraphs, there is no guarantee that changes 
                to a deferred write database are durable unless <code class="methodname">Database.sync()</code>
                is called or the database is closed. If you need guaranteed
                durability for an operation, consider using transactions instead of deferred write.
             </p>
          </div>
          <p>
                You should also be aware that <code class="methodname">Database.sync()</code> is a 
                relatively expensive operation because all outstanding changes to the 
                database are written, including internal index information. If you find 
                that you are calling <code class="methodname">Database.sync()</code> 
                frequently, consider using transactions.
        </p>
          <p>
            All other rules of behavior pertain to deferred write databases
            as they do to normal databases. Deferred write databases must be
            named and created just as you would a normal database. If you want to
            delete the deferred write database, you must remove it just as
            you would a normal database. This is true even if the deferred 
            write database is empty because its name persists in the
            environment's namespace until such a time as the database is
            removed.
        </p>
          <p>
            Note that determining whether a database is deferred write is a
            configuration option. It is therefore possible to switch a
            database between "normal" mode and deferred write database. You
            might want to do this if, for example, you want to load a lot
            of data to the database. In this case, loading data to the
            database while it is in deferred write state is faster than
            in "normal" state, because you can avoid a lot of the normal disk 
            I/O overhead during the load process. Once the load is
            complete, sync the database, close it, and and then reopen it 
            as a normal database. You can then continue operations 
            as if the database had been created as a "normal" database.
        </p>
          <p>
                To configure a database as deferred write, set
                <code class="methodname">DatabaseConfig.setDeferredWrite()</code>
                to <code class="literal">true</code> and then open the database with
                that <code class="classname">DatabaseConfig</code> option.
        </p>
          <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p>
                    If you are using the DPL, then you configure your entire
                    store to be deferred write using
                    <code class="methodname">StoreConfig.setDeferredWrite()</code>.
                    You can also sync every database in your store using
                    <code class="methodname">EntityStore.sync()</code>.
                </p>
          </div>

          <p>
                By default, all JE databases are durable; that is, the data that you put in them
                will remain in them across program runs, unless you explicitly delete the data. 
                However, it is possible to configure a
                <span class="emphasis"><em>temporary</em></span> database that is not durable. A temporary database is
                automatically deleted when it is closed or after a crash occurs.
        </p>
          <p>
                Temporary databases are essentially in-memory only databases. Therefore,
                they are particularly useful for applications that want databases which
                are truly temporary.
        </p>
          <p>
                Note that temporary databases do not always avoid disk I/O. It is particularly
                important to realize that temporary databases can page to disk if the cache is not
                large enough to hold the database's entire contents. Therefore, temporary database
                performance is best when your in-memory cache is large enough to hold the database's
                entire data-set.
        </p>
          <p>
                A temporary database operates internally in deferred write mode and has
                the same performance advantages as described above for deferred write
                databases (see <a class="xref" href="databases.html#dwdatabase" title="Deferred Write Databases">Deferred Write Databases</a>).
                However, unlike deferred write databases, a temporary database is not written
                during checkpoints and this provides an additional performance advantage.
        </p>
          <p>
                Temporary databases must be named and created just as you would a normal database.
                To configure a database as temporary, set 
                <code class="methodname">DatabaseConfig.setTemporary</code> to 
                <code class="literal">true</code> and then open the database with that 
                <code class="classname">DatabaseConfig</code> instance.
        </p>
          <p>
                For example:
        </p>
          <pre class="programlisting">package je.gettingStarted;

import com.sleepycat.je.Database;
import com.sleepycat.je.DatabaseConfig;
import com.sleepycat.je.DatabaseException;
import com.sleepycat.je.Environment;
import com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentConfig;

import java.io.File;
...

Environment myDbEnvironment = null;
Database myDatabase = null;

...

try {
    // Open the environment. Create it if it does not already exist.
    EnvironmentConfig envConfig = new EnvironmentConfig();
    envConfig.setAllowCreate(true);
    myDbEnvironment = new Environment(new File("/export/dbEnv"), 
                                      envConfig);

    // Open the database. Create it if it does not already exist.
    DatabaseConfig dbConfig = new DatabaseConfig();
    dbConfig.setAllowCreate(true);
    // Make it a temporary database
    dbConfig.setTemporary(true);
    myDatabase = myDbEnvironment.openDatabase(null, 
                                              "sampleDatabase", 
                                              dbConfig); 

    ...
    // do work
    ...

    // then close the database and environment here
    // (see the next section)

} catch (DatabaseException dbe) {
    // Exception handling goes here
}</pre>

          </div>
          <p>Once you are done using the database, you must close it. You use the
    <code class="methodname">Database.close()</code> method to do this.</p>
          <p>Closing a database causes it to become unusable until it is opened
    again. If any cursors are opened for the database, 
	JE warns you about the open cursors, and then closes them for you. 
    Active cursors during a database
    close can cause unexpected results, especially if any of those cursors are
    writing to the database in another thread. You should always make sure that all your
    database accesses have completed before closing your database.</p>
          <p>It is recommended that you close all your
    databases before closing the environment to which they belong.</p>
          <p>Cursors are described in <a class="xref" href="Cursors.html" title="Chapter 9. Using Cursors">Using Cursors</a> later in this manual.</p>
