<h3>Trace logging in Berkeley DB Java Edition</h3>
JE uses the <code><a
href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html">java.util.logging</a></code>
package to log operations and trace
messages. This information can be particularly useful when running a
replicated JE High Availability application in order to monitor your
application's activities. 
<p>
The default output lists replication node start up and shutdown
operations. Initial configuration problems should show up
during the startup operation. You are strongly advised to run your
production application with this level of logging.
<p>
Note that an application java.util.logging.Handler may be specified for
each environment through EnvironmentConfig.setLoggingHandler();
<p>
See the <a href="GettingStartedGuide/managelogging.html">Logging</a>
section in <a href="GettingStartedGuide/administration.html">
    Chapter 12, Administering Berkeley DB Java Edition Applications
</a> in the <a href="GettingStartedGuide/index.html">Getting Started Guide</a> for
details on logging configuration and locations. 
<h4>Example of logging output</h4>

The first column is the date in &lt;year&gt;-&lt;month&gt;-&lt;day&gt;
format.  Times are given in the UTC timezone.<br><br>
The default information when a master node (Node 1) comes up:

The master's perspective when a replica (Node 2) wants to be added, then subsequently joins and syncs up.
