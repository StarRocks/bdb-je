            To manage locks in JE, you must do two things:
        </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                    Manage lock timeouts.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Detect and respond to lock conflicts. Conceptually,
                    these are deadlocks. But from a coding point of view
                    there is no difference between what you do if a lock
                    times out, and what you do if you encounter a deadlock.
                    In fact, in JE, you cannot tell the difference
                    based on the exceptions that are thrown.
                </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
                Like transaction timeouts (see <a class="xref" href="maxtxns.html" title="Configuring the Transaction Subsystem">Configuring the Transaction Subsystem</a>),
                JE allows you to identify the longest period of time that it is allowed to hold a lock.
                This value plays an important part in performing deadlock detection, because the only way JE can
                identify a deadlock is if a lock is held past its timeout value.
            </p>
        <p>
                However, unlike transaction timeouts, lock timeouts are on a true timer. Transaction
                timeouts are only identified when JE is has a reason to examine its lock table; that is, 
                when it is attempting to acquire a lock. If no such activity is
                occurring in your application, a transaction can exist for a long time past its expiration timeout.
                Conversely, lock timeouts are managed by a timer maintained by the JVM. Once this timer has expired,
                your application will be notified of the event (see the next section on deadlock detection for more
                information).
            </p>
        <p>
                You can set the lock timeout on a transaction by transaction basis, or for the entire environment. To
                set it on a transaction basis, use <code class="methodname">Transaction.setLockTimeout()</code>.
                To set it for your entire environment, use <code class="methodname">EnvironmentConfig.setLockTimeout()</code>
                or use the <code class="literal">je.lock.timeout</code> parameter in the <code class="filename">je.properties</code> file.
            </p>
        <p>
                The value that you specify for the lock timeout is in microseconds. <code class="literal">500000</code> is used by
                default.
            </p>
        <p>
                Note that changing this value can have an affect on your application's performance. If you set it too
                low, locks may expire and be considered deadlocked even though the thread is in fact making
                forward progress. This will cause your application to abort and retry transactions unnecessarily, which
                can ultimately harm application throughput. 
                If you set it too high, threads may deadlock for too long before your application receives notification
                and is able to take corrective action. Again, this can harm application throughput.
            </p>
        <p>
                Note that for applications in which you will have extremely long-lived locks, you
                may want to set this value to <code class="literal">0</code>. Doing so disables lock timeouts
                entirely.  Be aware that disabling lock timeouts can be dangerous because then your
                application will never be notified of deadlocks. So, alternatively, you might want
                to set this value to a very large timeout (such as ten minutes) if your application
                is using extremely long-lived locks.
            </p>

        <p>
                A deadlock is the result of a lock conflict that cannot be
                resolved by the underlying JE code before the lock
                times out. Generically, we consider this situation a
                <span class="emphasis"><em>lock conflict</em></span> because there is no way
                to tell if the lock timed out because of a true deadlock,
                or if it timed out because a long-running operation simply
                held the lock for too long a period of time.
            </p>
        <p>
                When a lock conflict occurs in JE, the thread of control holding
                that lock is notified of the event using a
                <code class="classname">LockConflictException</code> exception. Note
                that this exception is actual a common base class for several
                exception classes that might be able to give you more of a
                hint as to what the actual problem is. However, the
                response that you make for any of these exceptions is
                probably going to be the same, so the best thing to do is
                simply catch and manage <code class="classname">LockConflictException</code>.
            </p>
        <p>
                When a <code class="classname">LockConflictException</code> is
                thrown, the thread must:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        Cease all read and write operations.
                    </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                        Close all open cursors.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Abort the transaction.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Optionally retry the operation. If your application
                        retries operations that are aborted due to a lock
                        conflict, the new attempt must be made using a new transaction.

                    If a thread has encountered a lock conflict, it may not make any
                    additional database calls using the transaction handle that has
                    experienced the lock conflict.
