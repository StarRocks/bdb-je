This directory backups all the test scripts of JE tests that run on Jenkins.

There are 4 serious of tests for JE:
  Coverage Test
  Dbsim Test
  Unit Test
  Standalone Test

The description and usage about these 4 serious of tests are in the README file at their own directory.

In addition, the file JE_test_deploy.xlsx gives the visualization of some information about all JE tests, including the test machine, the issued time and the duration time of each test.

All 15 JE Standalone tests run on slc04arq and they use the same test script je_standalone.sh.
All 11 JE Unit tests run on slc04arq and slc04atb, where slc04arq runs 6 weekly running tests and slc04atb runs 5 daily running tests. They use the same test script je_unit.sh. Note that one daily running test will be always run with the default repository.
All 5 JE DBsim tests run on slc04aro and they use the same test script je_dbsim.sh.

JE Standalone tests and JE DBsim tests need to extract and check error from log file. They use the same error extract script error_extract_je.sh.
