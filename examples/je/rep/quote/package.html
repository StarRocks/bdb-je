JE Replication Stock Quote example.

<h2>Example Overview</h2>
This example is a simple but complete demonstration of a replicated
application.  The application is a mock stock ticker which stores stock values
in a replicated JE environment. The following commands are accepted:
<ul>
<li>&lt;stock&gt; &lt;number&gt; : enter this stock price into the
database</li>
<li>print : print all the stocks and current prices held in the database</li>
<li>quit : shut down</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are three versions of the example which illustrate different application
designs and aspects of JE functionality.  Please be sure to walk through the
three examples in the order listed below, since the information in one example
builds on the one before it.  The javadoc description for each class describes
the example and explains how to run it.  More detailed information is found in
the example source code.
<ol>
<li>{@link je.rep.quote.StockQuotes StockQuotes}: This example is the most
basic demonstration of a replicated application. It's intended to help gain an
understanding of basic HA concepts and demonstrate use of the HA APIs to create
a replicated environment and issue read and write transactions.
</li><br>
<li>{@link je.rep.quote.RouterDrivenStockQuotes RouterDrivenStockQuotes} and
{@link je.rep.quote.HARouter HARouter}: This example is based on {@code
StockQuotes} and illustrates use of an HA-aware router (implemented by {@code
HARouter}), in conjunction with the {@link com.sleepycat.je.rep.monitor.Monitor
Monitor} class, to direct application requests, based upon the type of request
(read or write) and the state (Master or Replica) of a node in the replication
group.  This example is meant to illustrate how a software load balancer might
be integrated with JE HA, where {@code HARouter} plays the role of the load
balancer for purposes of the example.
</li><br>
<li>{@link je.rep.quote.UpdateForwardingStockQuotes
UpdateForwardingStockQuotes} and {@link je.rep.quote.SimpleRouter
SimpleRouter}: This example is based on {@code RouterDrivenStockQuotes} and
illustrates use of an HA unaware router (implemented by {@code SimpleRouter}),
that load balances requests (both read and write) across all the nodes in a
replication group.  This example is meant to illustrate how a load balancer
appliance might fit into the JE HA architecture, where {@code SimpleRouter}
plays the role of the load balancer appliance for purposes of the example.
</li>
</ol>
<em>Disclaimer:</em> This example is intended to be illustrative.  The example
is single threaded, while actual applications may be multithreaded.  The
example forwards requests as text and receives responses in text form, while
actual applications may for example, forward HTTP requests, or use some other
application level network protocol to forward such requests. The example opens
and closes a socket to send each request, while actual applications will
typically use a connection management facility.
<p>
The example 
{@link je.rep.quote.StockQuotesRMIForwarding StockQuotesRMIForwarding}, 
a minor variation to the basic {@link je.rep.quote.StockQuotes StockQuotes} 
example is also included in this package. It's intended to help illustrate how 
RMI could be used to forward write requests from a Replica to the Master.
